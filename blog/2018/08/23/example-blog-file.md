# This is an example blog!

The content of the blog can be written in Markdown, directly in the Github editor. Markdown is easy to master, and [Github have a good guide here][github-markdown-guide].

You can see that a photo is referenced directly under the blog title. The logic of the blog will be coded to display the first image as the blog header, which is optional.

Any other photo can be placed inline using the same markdown syntax:

## Dating the articles

Store blog articles in the format of `blog/year/month/day/title.md`, and the blog logic will then be able to load these files in and organise them by date automatically.

All of this is configurable to taste, but it makes the most sense to me this way.
